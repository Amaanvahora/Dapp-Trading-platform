enjoy the code happy coding

just made this awesome project  called the DEFI trading platform

in this project I have imbedded 4 fake ERC-20 tokens named DAI, BAT,ZRX , and REP  made using #OpenZeppelin  in this I have given the first four accounts mine 1 #ethereum  equivalent fake ERC-20 tokens 



there is a withdraw and a deposit function by the withdraw button you can invest fake #crypto tokens present in your account to the trading application and by depositing you can deposit the tokens earned to your account 



also, there is a function called limit order and market order 

limit order means that you want to buy or sell n number of tokens at the highest price that you will put in the input field 



market orders mean that you want to buy or sell n number of tokens at whatever price that is available in the market



the trading algorithm matches  the limit order and the market orders and creates a trade between the tokens and price that person who wants the tokens at any price get the tokens and the person who wants to sell at a specific price sells it so its all about the working of this DAPP



I have followed Julien Klepatch's tutorial series available on 

https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/ this website 



thanks, Julien Klepatch for making this awesome course on decentralized applications using Ethereum and solidity.
